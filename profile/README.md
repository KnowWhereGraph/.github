## Welcome

KnowWhereGraph aims at providing area briefings within seconds for any region on Earth to answer questions such as

- What is here?
- What happened here before?
- Who knows more?
- How does it compare to other regions or previous events?

By doing so, we assist decision-makers and data scientists in rapidly enriching their data with billions of connected, up-to-date facts at the human-environment interface to gain the situational awareness required for good decision-making.

KnowWhereGraph is the first to fuse a knowledge graph with geo-enrichment, thereby making the graph directly available from within Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other environments. This also includes bespoke solutions such as services and interfaces for humanitarian relief, food supply chains, credit risk, and so on. 

## Active Work & Products

KnowWhereGraph has several active initiatives, outlined below.

### Ontology Development

One of the most difficult questions research face is how to synthesize massive amounts of data from a variety of data sources. The KnowWhereGraph team tackles this problem by utilizing the latest paradigms of ontology development.

View the current version of the ontology [here](https://stko-kwg.geog.ucsb.edu/lod/ontology)

### Knowledge Explorer

Because KnowWhereGraph has so much data, it can be difficult to find whether the data you need is present in the graph. The Knowledge Explorer is our solution to this problem.

Use the Knowledge Explorer [here](https://stko-kwg.geog.ucsb.edu/).

### KnowWhereGraph API

One of the key pillars of linked data is the ability to dereference URI's. Our API supports both content negotiation for RDF formats as well as browser redirects for easy information viewing.

### KnowWhereGraph Python Package

The KnowWhereGraph's Python package is designed to help developers make use of the vast ontology by providing easy to use classes.

Find the package on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pykwg/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/KnowWhereGraph/pykwg).

### Infrastructure Deployment

We believe that data should be democratized. We've included Dockerized, out of the box deployment configurations so that *any one* can deploy KnowWhereGraph on their own machine.

To deploy your own instance of KnowWhereGraph, visit the deployment repository [here](https://github.com/KnowWhereGraph/kwg-deployment)
