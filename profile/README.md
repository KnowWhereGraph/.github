## Welcome

KnowWhereGraph aims at providing area briefings within seconds for any region on Earth to answer questions such as

- What is here?
- What happened here in the past?
- Who knows more about this area?
- How does it compare to other regions or previous events?

KnowWhereGraph is the first to fuse a knowledge graph with geo-enrichment, thereby making the graph directly available from within Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other environments. This also includes bespoke solutions such as services and interfaces for humanitarian relief, food supply chains, credit risk, and so on.
